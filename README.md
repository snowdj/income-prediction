The goal of this session is to give you a hands-on taste on how to use the different features of the DataScience Platform, including conducting analyses, publishing reports, scheduling scripts, and deploying models. 

There will be two main parts to this demo:
1. Analysis 
2. Deploying the model as an API

#### Analysis
In this part of the session we'll perform an analysis.

Procedure:
1. Import and install modules for our analysis.
2. Load our data.
3. Run some analyses.

#### Deploying the model as an API
We'll deploy a model as an API using the platform. By deploying the model as an API anyone in the organization with an API key can query it, including any apps that the engineering team has developed.
